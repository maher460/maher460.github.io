Welcome to my site!

I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in distributed systems, fault and intrusion tolerance, privacy, and consistency and availability. My research has been published in several top-tier conferences. In 2017, I earned dual degrees in Computer Science and Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University.

With over six years of programming experience, I bring a robust background in software engineering. I am proficient in system, web, application, and AI/ML development, and have extensive experience with cloud computing platforms such as AWS and Azure. My programming expertise includes C, Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

In addition to my technical skills, I have a proven track record as an educator in higher education. I have presented my research at various conferences and seminars and have taught lectures and recitations, effectively communicating complex concepts to students and diverse audiences.

I am actively exploring new opportunities in the tech industry where I can apply my skills and make a significant impact. Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to connecting with you!
